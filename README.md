=========

This is the code of Galaxy Zoo participation for team 'X'.

You need to install torch, with qlua. The training data should be downloaded and extracted to the 'data' directory.

To run the program, execute the command

$ qlua main.lua

The program has a nice visualization of the convolutional neural networks being trained.

You can easily change all configurations in the file 'config.lua'. It is quite self-explanatory.
